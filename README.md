# E-commerce Sales Analytics Dashboard

In this project, I performed an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Superstore dataset to uncover key sales and profit drivers across regions, categories, customer segments, and time.

### Objectives
1. Analyze sales, profit, and discount patterns.
2. Identify high- and low-performing business areas.
3. Provide data-driven recommendations to improve profitability.

### Project Details
This project was completed as a personal analytics project to apply Python-based data science techniques in a business context.  
Using **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**, I explored the dataset, built KPIs, visualized regional and categorical performance, and examined how discounting strategies affect profit margins.  

Key insights included:
- Discounts ≥ 30% strongly reduced profits.
- Central region had high sales but poor margins.
- Technology category and corporate clients yielded the best profitability.

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels  
**Dataset:** [Superstore Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)
